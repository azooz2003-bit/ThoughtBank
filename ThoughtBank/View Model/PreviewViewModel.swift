//
//  Separate view model implementation for generating previews.
//
//  This is not used by the live app, but can assist in providing dummy
//  data to the previews (which can be helpful for debugging the UI).
//
//  It also ensures that the previews are not actually making any calls
//  to external APIs such as Firebase.
