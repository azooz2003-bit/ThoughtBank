    // GENERAL HINTS:
    // - Use FirebaseManager to interact with Firebase for each function that involves manipulation of data.
    // - Can we call async functions from a synchronous thread? Do we need to spawn a new thread?  (key components: the "Task" wrapper, look into it)
    // - How do we go back to the main thread after handling an async task? (key components: the DispatchQueue.main.async wrapper, look into it)

     1. FirebaseManager has a pretty similar function. It will do most of the work for you, pay attention to the fact that it 'throws'.
     2. We have a local 'user' variable, we probably want to set instantiate  that don't we.
     3. We have a local 'shouldLoadBlocking' variable which indicates whether we want to present a loading spinner, turn that on while it is still being processed in the backend, and turn it off after it's complete (regardless of success or failure).
     
     - Parameters:
     - email: the email of the user
     - password: the password of the user
